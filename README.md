WME-ja
======

Waze Map Editor (WME) addon to help with junction design.
If two connected segments are selected, it shows the turn angle, otherwise the the angle between each segment.
I try to test with both Chrome (with Tampermonkey, as the userscript functionality changed) and Firefox (Greasemonkey), 
but anything might break at any given time anyway :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wme-junctionangle/cfcpfikgmfoghjfpfepmklballeagadf) and 
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wme-ja/) extensions are available also. 

See [Waze wiki pages](https://wiki.waze.com/wiki/Community_Plugins,_Extensions_and_Tools#WME_Junction_Angle_info) for more information on map editing addons
